# Examples and Tutorials

Work in progress to provide a Rust version of some of the examples and tutorials from the official [Hopsworks repository](https://github.com/logicalclocks/hopsworks-tutorials). Numerous functionalities are either not implemented or implemented differently in the Rust API. Therefore the examples are neither an exact match nor fully functional yet. Contributions to port parts of the examples are welcome!

Some examples are also simply snippets that demonstrate how to use a specific functionality. They are somewhat redundant with either unit or doc tests, but included as they can be helpful template scripts. You can find them in the `snippets` folder.
